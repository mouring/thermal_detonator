# Star Wars Thermal Detonator Project

This is a first pass at collecting up all the pieces for this.

Board diagram is mine along with the Itsy Bity (M0 express or RP2040 M0) CircuitPython code.

The audio is from youtube (sorry, forgot the source) and my long term goal is
to replace it with a built-in tone generator version. As I don't like the
audio quality.

The model right now is based on: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4192025

More pictures and details as I work throught the details.  

TODO:

- Determine swtich
- Finish up board layout (done, not uploaded yet)
- Solder together 
- Determine how to buld audio as a tone generator
- Paint
- Assemble
