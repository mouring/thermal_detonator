# Star Wars Thermal Detonator Project

This is a first pass at collecting up all the pieces for this.

Board diagram is mine along with the Itsy Bity CircuitPython code.

The audio is from youtube (sorry, forgot the source) and my long term goal is
to replace it with a built-in tone generator version. As I don't like the
audio quality.

The model right now is based on: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4192025

More pictures and details as I work throught the details.  

TODO:

- Determine swtich
- Finish up board layout
- Solder together
- Rework lower model to support USB charging port
- Consider seperating center ring out from model
- Determine how to buld audio as a tone generator
- Paint
- Assemble
